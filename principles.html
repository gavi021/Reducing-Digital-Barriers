            <h2>Accessibility Principles</h2>
                <p> 
                    Web accessibility is guided by the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), which define four core 
                    principles. These principles provide a framework for creating content that can be accessed by users with diverse abilities.
                </p>
            <h3>Perceivable</h3>
                <p>
                    Content must be presented in ways that users can perceive. This includes providing text alternatives for images, ensuring 
                    sufficient color contrast, and allowing text to be resized without loss of functionality.

                    When information is not perceivable, users with visual impairments or sensory limitations may be unable to access content.
                </p>
            <h3>Operable</h3>
                <p>
                    Users must be able to navigate and interact with content using different input methods. Websites should support keyboard 
                    navigation, avoid time-based interactions, and ensure that controls are usable across devices.

                    Poor operability can prevent users from completing basic tasks such as navigating menus or submitting forms.
                </p>
            <h3>Understandable</h3>
                <p>
                    Information and navigation should be clear, predictable, and easy to comprehend. Simple language, consistent layouts, 
                    and intuitive controls reduce cognitive load and improve usability.

                    Complex or inconsistent designs can disproportionately affect users with cognitive impairments and older adults.
                </p>
            <h3>Robust</h3>
                <p>
                    Content should be compatible with a wide range of browsers, devices, and assistive technologies. 
                    Using proper HTML structure helps ensure that content remains accessible as technologies evolve.
