            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p> This website accompanies the paper Reducing Digital Barriers for Cognitive, Visual, and Age-Related Needs. 
                    It explores how the evolution of web design has introduced accessibility challenges and demonstrates how 
                    inclusive design principles can help reduce those barriers.
                    The site is intentionally designed to follow Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)
                        and to provide an example of how accessible web content can benefit individuals with disabilities, 
                        older adults, and users with diverse needs.
                </p>
            <h3>Why Accessibility Matters</h3>
                <p>Accessibility is essential for equitable access to online services such as healthcare 
                    portals, government resources, banking systems, and educational platforms. When websites 
                    are not designed with accessibility in mind, individuals with disabilities and older 
                    adults may be excluded from participating fully in society.
                </p>
