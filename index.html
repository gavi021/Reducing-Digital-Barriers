            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p> This website accompanies the paper Reducing Digital Barriers for Cognitive, Visual, and Age-Related Needs. 
                    It explores how the evolution of web design has introduced accessibility challenges and demonstrates how 
                    inclusive design principles can help reduce those barriers.
                    The site is intentionally designed to follow Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)
                        and to provide an example of how accessible web content can benefit individuals with disabilities, 
                        older adults, and users with diverse needs.
                </p>
                <h3>Why Accessibility Matters</h3>
                    <p>Accessible websites are essential for equitable participation in modern society. 
                        Many critical services—including healthcare portals, government resources, banking systems,
                        educational platforms, and job applications—are now primarily accessed online.

                        When websites are not designed with accessibility in mind, individuals with cognitive, 
                        visual, or age-related impairments may be unable to access essential information or 
                        services. Improving accessibility helps ensure that all users can interact with digital 
                        content independently and effectively.
                    </p>
                <h3>Accessibility Commitment</h3>
                    <p>
                        This website prioritizes accessibility through clear structure, readable text, 
                        consistent navigation, keyboard accessibility, and high-contrast design. Accessibility 
                        is an ongoing process, and feedback is welcome.

                        Use the navigation above to explore accessibility principles, barriers to access, tools, 
                        and design considerations for older adults.
