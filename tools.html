            <h2>Tools That Improve Accessibility</h2>
                <h3>Assistive Technologies</h3>
                    <p>
                        Assistive technologies such as screen readers, magnifiers, and alternative input devices help users interact with
                         digital content. These tools can bridge gaps between a user’s abilities and their environment but may be costly or require training.

                        Limited access and lack of familiarity can reduce their effectiveness.
                    </p>
                <h3>Browser and Operating System Features</h3>
                    <p>
                        Modern browsers and operating systems include built-in accessibility features such as text scaling, high-contrast modes, 
                        reader views, speech-to-text, and text-to-speech.

                        These tools are widely available and require no additional cost, but many users—particularly older adults—are unaware of 
                        how to enable or use them effectively.
                    </p>
                <h3>Accessibility Checkers</h3>
                    <p>
                        Accessibility checkers help developers identify technical issues such as missing alternative text, poor contrast, or 
                        improper heading structure. Tools such as WAVE, Lighthouse, axe, and TAW are commonly used.

                        While valuable, automated tools cannot fully assess usability or user experience. Effective accessibility practices require 
                        a combination of automated testing, manual review, and feedback from users with disabilities.
