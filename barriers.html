            <h2>Barriers to Accessibility</h2>
                <p> 
                    Despite the existence of accessibility standards, many websites continue to present significant barriers to users.
                </p>
                <h3>Visual Design Barriers</h3>
                    <p>
                        Design choices such as small text, low color contrast, and decorative fonts can make content difficult or impossible 
                        to read for users with visual impairments. These issues often arise from a lack of awareness rather than intentional exclusion.

                        While accessibility guidelines are publicly available, they are not widely understood or consistently applied.
                    </p>
                <h3>Structural and Navigation Barriers</h3>
                    <p>
                        Website usability depends heavily on clear structure and consistent navigation. Complex layouts, inconsistent menus, 
                        and poorly labeled links can make it difficult for users to find information.

                        Assistive technologies such as screen readers may fail to function properly when websites lack semantic 
                        structure or behave differently across devices.
                    </p>
                <h3>Cognitive Barriers</h3>
                    <p>
                        Pop-ups, animations, dense text, and unpredictable interactions increase cognitive load. These elements can 
                        overwhelm users with cognitive impairments and make websites difficult to use for older adults.

                        Reducing unnecessary distractions improves accessibility for all users.
