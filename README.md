# Reducing Digital Barriers

## Overview

The rapid evolution of the internet has surfaced critical digital accessibility issues that disproportionately impact users with cognitive, visual, and age-related conditions. As websites incorporate increasingly complex elements, dynamic components, and intricate layouts, many users encounter barriers that impede equitable access to online information and services.

This repository contains an accessible companion website developed alongside the research paper *Reducing Digital Barriers for Cognitive, Visual, and Age-Related Needs*. The project examines the historical development of web design, analyzes research documenting the growth of web complexity, and demonstrates how these changes affect users with disabilities and older adults.

Grounded in standards established by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), the website serves as a practical example of inclusive web design. It explores structural, visual, and navigational accessibility barriers while highlighting the limitations of current practices and the need for more inclusive design frameworks that support equitable participation in an increasingly digital society.

## Project Goals

- Demonstrate accessible web design practices informed by WCAG  
- Translate academic research into a practical, usable example  
- Highlight accessibility challenges related to cognitive, visual, and age-related needs  
- Support awareness of digital inclusion and equitable access  

## Website Structure

The website includes the following sections:

- **Home** – Project overview and accessibility context  
- **Accessibility Principles** – WCAG concepts explained in plain language  
- **Barriers to Accessibility** – Visual, structural, and navigational challenges  
- **Older Adults and Web Use** – Age-related accessibility considerations  
- **Tools and Features** – Assistive technologies, browser/OS features, and accessibility checkers  
- **Accessibility Statement** – Design choices and accessibility commitments  
- **References** – Academic sources informing the project  

## Accessibility Approach

This project prioritizes accessibility through:

- Semantic HTML structure  
- Keyboard-accessible navigation  
- Clear and consistent layout  
- Readable typography and sufficient color contrast  
- Minimal reliance on ARIA, used only when necessary  

Accessibility is treated as an ongoing process rather than a fixed outcome.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- WCAG-informed accessibility practices  

No external frameworks or libraries are used to maintain simplicity and clarity.

## Purpose

This project was created for academic research and instructional purposes. It is intended to demonstrate how accessibility principles can be integrated into real-world web design and to encourage more inclusive approaches to digital development.

## Feedback

Accessibility is an evolving practice. Feedback regarding accessibility barriers or suggestions for improvement is welcome.
